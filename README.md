Hospitality Data: Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations
1. Performance Overview
Upon analyzing data from three consecutive months, we observe that the Average Daily Rate (ADR) remained constant across the hotels, while there were slight fluctuations in Occupancy % and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR). Given that these months fall within the holiday season, there is a significant opportunity to optimize ADR on peak daysâ€”such as weekends and public holidaysâ€”when demand naturally increases due to family travel. Strategically increasing ADR during these high-demand periods could enhance revenue without significantly affecting occupancy. This calculated risk is likely worth taking.

2. Understanding Demand Patterns
In the hospitality industry:
Weekends typically refer to Friday and Saturday
Weekdays span Sunday to Thursday
By examining revenue trends between weekdays and weekends:
If weekday revenue is higher, the hotel likely caters to business travelers
If weekend revenue is stronger, it indicates a leisure-focused hotel
From the week-over-week (WoW) analysis in our dataset:
Revenue differences are minor
However, Occupancy % varies by approximately 7%, suggesting a leisure-driven market
ADR and realization (actual sales) remain stable, indicating potential for ADR growth without major occupancy loss.

4. Recommended Pricing Strategy
To optimize performance, the following pricing models are advised:
Flat Pricing: A fixed rate per room, regardless of the day
Weekday/Weekend Pricing: Adjust rates based on demand patterns between weekdays and weekends
Dynamic Pricing: Implement rate changes in real time, especially during holiday seasons or based on demand forecasts
Hotels should increasingly leverage dynamic pricing, particularly during peak holiday periods, to maximize revenue while maintaining competitiveness.

5. Relationship Between Pricing and Occupancy
The data reaffirms a standard pricing-occupancy dynamic:
Higher pricing generally leads to lower occupancy
Lower pricing tends to increase occupancy
This relationship must be balanced thoughtfully based on the hotel's positioning (business vs. leisure) and current market trends.

6. Strategy for Low Occupancy Hotels
Apply the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule):
Often, 80% of revenue comes from 20% of high-value guests or corporate clients
Focus marketing and service enhancements toward these high-value segments
Additionally, improve underperforming hotels by addressing:
Guest Ratings: Top-performing hotels have better ratings; poorly rated properties show lower revenues
Action Plan:
Enhance digital presence through strategic social media marketing and engagement
Audit service quality: Determine whether low ratings stem from actual service issues or misaligned guest expectations
