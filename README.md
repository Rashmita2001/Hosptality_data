# Hosptality_data_key insights:
If we analyse the data,we can see that from all three months that ADR is same within the hotels while there is slight difference in occupancy% and RevPar. So as these months comes in holidays season so the comapny can increse in there ADR depending on the peak days of the months like in weekend or holidays as mostly families spends their holidays in traveling so its a good choice for level up the revenues.Its is worth the risk.
In hotels weekend counts from Friday and Saturday and Weekday counts from Sunday to Thursday, so from the data we can check that if revenue is good in weekdays,then we cans say it is a business hotels and if revenue is higher comparative to weekdays then the hotel is leasure hotel. But in the data as we can see WoW(as on hotels sales varies weekly wise) analysis there is slight difference in Revenue ,but in Occupancy% there is alomst 7% diiference we can say they are leasure hotels,but ADR is almost same and even Realisation(Actually Sales) also so then we can say the company can increase there ADR . The Solution: The pricing category in hotels: FLAT PRICING:Fixed Pricing Rate per room AND Weekday/Weekend Pricing:As for the hotels occupancy% and ADR hotels can increase or decearse their ADR in weekend/Weekday. And then comes DYNAMIC PRICING: Peak holiday seasons ,the hotels can increase or decearse their ADR  weekly wise.
From the data we can realise that RevPar depends on ADR
How does the pricing influence the Occupancy%?
Pricing (Up) then Occupancy% (Down)
Pricing (Down) then Occupancy% (Up)
What to do with the lowest occupancy hotels?
Apply the Panito Priciple: e.g., That 80%(Result) of the Revenue Coming from 20%(Effort) of high value Guests or Corporate Clients.
If we check the hotels with best revenues we can see that they have good rating on the other side there are hotels with lowest revenue have bad ratings, so here we can check the two things:First: as we know now a days everything is on social media, promoting hotels in social media whether with good marketing plan or genuine ratings from customer so here we can imporve that for the hotels and Second: Chceking there services Is it bad only in ratings or genuinely problem in their services and rooms according to their proviving. 
Thses are the decisions that we can take by reviewing the data for the company to improve their market shares and revenues.
